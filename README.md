🏠 StayEase – PG Listing & Booking Portal

StayEase is a web-based platform designed to simplify the process of finding and booking Paying Guest (PG) accommodations. The system connects PG owners and tenants through an easy-to-use interface, allowing users to explore listings, view details, and manage bookings efficiently.

📌 Project Overview

Finding suitable PG accommodation is often time-consuming and lacks centralized information. StayEase solves this problem by providing a digital platform where users can browse verified PG listings based on location, price, amenities, and availability.

The platform also helps PG owners manage their property listings, rooms, and bookings in an organized manner.
